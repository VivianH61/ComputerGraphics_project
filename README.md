# ComputerGraphics_project
In this project, I built a 3D model for city scene based on OpenGL. The components of the model consist of road, vegetations and buildings including a bell tower, a museum, office buildings and residential houses. I applied knowledges gained from this module to this project, including translation, rotation, hierarchical modelling, projection, texturing, animation and lighting.
